## Face Detection with OpenCV and JavaFX

*Computer Vision course - [Politecnico di Torino](http://www.polito.it) - academic year 2014-2015*

A project, made in Eclipse (Luna), for detecting human faces in a video taken from a webcam. It uses the Haar and LBP classifiers already available in the OpenCV library.

Please, note that the project is an Eclipse project, made for teaching purposes. Before using it, you need to install the OpenCV library (version 2.4.9) and JavaFX (version 2 or superior) and create a `User Library` named `opencv2` that links to the OpenCV jar and native libraries.
